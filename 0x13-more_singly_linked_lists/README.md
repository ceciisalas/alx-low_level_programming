A lined list a data structure for storing a collection of data elements. The elements in the collection can be of any data such as int, char, float. Linked lists store each data elements inside a node. A node consists of 2 fields - a data field which stores the actual data and a pointer field whic contains a pointer to the next node. So the first node (the node on the top of the list) contains some data and a pointer to the second node, the second node also contains some data and a pointer to the third node and so on. The last node in the list will point to NULL. A the pointer to the node at the top of the list is called head pointer
